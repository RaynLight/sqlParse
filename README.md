# sqlParse
This is my final project for my Object Oriented Class
https://github.com/RaynLight/sqlParse

# Usage
sqlParse can be used as a general MSSQL client allowing you to run queries against an MSSQL server.

# Logging
sqlParse logs everything you do, it creates a folder called "logs" and logs queries, scans, connections, etc.
